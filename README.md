# qc_material_flows
This repository is part of a master's thesis that has analyzed the transferability of a logistics optimization use case (VRP) to a material flow resource optimization use case (FJSP).
Thererfore a new material flow model has been conceptualized by using a circuit-based approach and the Qiskit SKD. 

To execute a simulation, please download the repository and start the IPYNB file "material_flows_qaoa.ipynb" as Jupyter Notebook in the Anaconda Python distribution. If the Qiskit environment and other required libraries are not setup yet, please follow the instructions given in Appendix I of the thesis or reference to the given providers. All further descriptions and functionalities are outlined in the IPYNB file. 

Further, the repository includes the code to generate an easy bell state simulation on real cloud-based quantum hardware, as conducted in chapter 2.2 of the thesis. It is provided in the file "bell_state_phi+_(entangelement).ipynb".
