The start-end relations are transferred into arrays in which one sub-array represents the feasible machines of one product for one respective time step. For example, the first operation of material flow 2 (colored purple) needs to be performed by machine *M2* or *M3*, the second operation by *M1* or *M6*, and the last by *M4* or *M5*. For each scenario, so for each unit in the array, one qubit is responsible. As you can see, there are a total of 24 qubits needed to simulate all three material flows.
